# GHA Dashboard Pipeline

This project builds an automated dashboard that monitors GitHub Actions workflows for a target repository (e.g., `milvus-io/milvus`). It uses the open-source tool **GHAminer** to extract workflow metrics, stores them in **PostgreSQL**, and visualizes insights via **Grafana**.

## Objectives

- Automatically extract GitHub Actions workflow data
- Store metrics in a structured PostgreSQL database
- Visualize KPIs in an interactive Grafana dashboard
- Enable future extensions for machine learning (ML) predictions

## Tech Stack

| Component      | Purpose                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GHAminer       | Extract GitHub Actions build + test metrics    |
| Python         | Automate ingestion and transformation scripts  |
| ReactJS        | Visual dashboard for KPIs and trends           |

## Wrapper Setup (Python)

- Having Python 3.13.2 in your machine
### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pipenv install
```

> Make sure you have Python 3.11+ and `pipenv` installed.

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
```

### 4. Run the Backend Server

```bash
pipenv run uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

Server will be running at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 5. Trigger GHAMiner Run

Send a POST request to the `/refresh` endpoint:

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/refresh
```

## Dashboard Setup (React)

- The Dashboard is the HTML page that will display the data as tables and graphs
    - Will be hosted by the github pages feature that allows to host publicly a static website (to discuss)
- The source files are located in the dashboard folder
- The project uses Webpack to build and generate final files in the docs folder
- To run the website (Dashboard) locally you will have to:
    - `cd `into the dashboard folder
    - run the command: `npm install`
    - run the command: `npm run dev`
    - go to the local address given from terminal (use web browser)
- The data_samples.csv file is here for testing
    - After uploading it, there will be a table that has the file's content displayed (for now)
    - Console logs the content of the csv file too
- Usefull commands:
    - `npm run build` used to build and bundle the files without running a local server 
    - `npm run dev` used to build and bundle the files, then to run a local server to test and see the outcome

## Tracked KPIs

- Workflow success rate
- Average build duration
- Top failing workflows
- PR authors with repeated failures
- Workflow volume over time

## Future Extensions (ML)

The data pipeline is designed to support future machine learning use cases, such as:
- Predicting workflow failure likelihood
- Forecasting build duration
- Scoring workflow flakiness
- Clustering logs for failure analysis

# Privacy Policy  

GHA-Dashboard is an open-source Chrome extension that helps GitHub users analyze their GitHub Actions workflow performance through a visual dashboard injected directly into the GitHub UI.  

## What the Extension Does  
- Displays a metrics dashboard directly on GitHub repository pages.  
- Optionally connects to the GHAMiner tool running on your local machine to fetch precomputed workflow metrics.

## What the Extension Does Not Do  
- It does not collect or store any personal data.
- It does not track your browsing or activity.
- It does not send any data to external servers.
- It does not access your GitHub credentials or private repositories.

## Your Data, Your Control  
All metrics and data used by the extension stay on your local machine. If you use GHAMiner, it processes public GitHub repository data locally — you remain the sole owner of that data.  

## Open Source Transparency  
This project is fully open-source. You’re welcome to explore the code, suggest improvements, or contribute.
